  <h2>
    What do I do? What problems do I solve?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Jossware is a technology consulting firm dedicated to helping clients solve technical problems. My mission is to build a partnership with customers through an ongoing process of open communication and technical leadership, with the ultimate goal of delivering real business value. Whether your business is looking to increase revenue, streamline inefficient operations, reduce risk or cut overhead, I can apply technology to help you achieve your goals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jossware specializes in full-stack web application development. I can build software applications from the ground up, or work to enhance pre-existing applications. Internal tools, customer-facing applications, e-commerce or marketing sites - I have the broad expertise and experience to get these done.
  </p>

  <h2>What Kind of Clients Do I Work For?</h2>

  <p>Jossware can help businesses at all stages. I have worked with large, established companies producing millions of dollars of revenue to small, self-funded solo-founder startups. If you need a software solution built from the ground up, Jossware can do it. If your existing team needs technical advisement, review, guidance or training, Jossware can help with that too. If you have vision, drive, and a singular focus on achieving business success, I'd love to be a part of your team.
  </p>

  <p>The majority of my clients are early stage bootstrapped startups, often with a single, non-technical founder. If you have an idea for a technology driven business or software application, I can assist in moving your concept from raw idea to a reality.</p>

  <h2>What Are the Benefits of Working With Me?</h2>

  <p>Working with Jossware means having smart, business-savvy professionals dedicated to helping your business succeed. I use an agile methodology and test-driven development to rapidly iterate on your ideas and refine your concept, until I have a solid foundation to build the product. All while maintaining a stable foundation and solid technical design. Through an ongoing process of open communication, quick feedback loops and adaptability, I build trust and accountability and ensure minimized risk and maximized impact. I am invested in your success from the very first hour of the project to its launch. Your success is our success.</p>
